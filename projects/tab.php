Sleigh Ride
(Mitchell Parish/Leroy Anderson)


                C            Am
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Dm        G        C    Am   Dm   
ring ting tingling too
     G        C      Am  
Come on, it's lovely weather
      Dm             G          C   Am  Dm 
for a sleigh ride together with you,
   G        C       Am
Outside the snow is falling
    Dm          G            C   Am  Dm
and friends are calling "Yoo hoo,"
     G        C      Am
Come on, it's lovely weather
      Dm          G             C
for a sleigh ride together with you.


      F#m                 B
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up,
         E
let's go, Let's look at the show,
F#m               B             E
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
      Em                  A
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up,
            D
it's grand, Just holding your hand,
Dm
We're gliding along with a song
     G
of a wintry fairy land.

               C        Am ... (etc)
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
like birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you.


          C
There's a christmas party
               
at the home of Farmer Gray
		  C
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
         C
We'll be singing the songs
   F                G            Am
we love to sing without a single stop,
       E                  F#m
At the fireplace while we watch
    B         E    Dm        G
the chestnuts pop. Pop! pop! pop!
          C
There's a happy feeling

nothing in the world can buy,
		  C
When they pass around the coffee

and the pumpkin pie
      C                F
It'll nearly be like a picture print
   G           Am
by Currier and Ives
Dm
These wonderful things are the things
     G
we remember all through our lives!


                C            Am (etc)
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
and friends are calling "Yoo hoo,"
Come on, it's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you.
